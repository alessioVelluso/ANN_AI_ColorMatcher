# ANN_ColorMatcher

Little ANN made for studies, there are so much wrong stuff but its just for fun and to approach the Deep Learning.

If you want to test it you will need:\
### Python 3.11.1
> `tensorflow 2.12.0`\
> `scikit-learn 1.2.2`\
> `pandas 1.5.2`\
> `numpy 1.23.5`\
> `Flask 2.2.3` if you want to see the whole web application.

If this get going and i really understand how to work it i'm going to wrap it in a venv but till then, feel free to suggest some improvements ;)
