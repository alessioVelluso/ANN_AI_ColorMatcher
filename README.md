# ANN_ColorMatcher

Little ANN made for studies, it can pair a passed hex-string (also never seen before) and pair it to a color that should fit well above the one passed.\
I know there are lot of wrong stuff in the process but its just for fun and to approach the Deep Learning!

If you want to test it you will need:
### Python 3.11.1
> `tensorflow 2.12.0`\
> `scikit-learn 1.2.2`\
> `pandas 1.5.2`\
> `numpy 1.23.5`\
> `Flask 2.2.3`\
Then you can `cd app` & `py app.py`.

If this get going and i really understand how to work it i'm going to wrap it in a venv but till then, feel free to suggest some improvements ;)
